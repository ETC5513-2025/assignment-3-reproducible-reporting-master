# Our finding

-   Climate change and sustainability challenges
-   Shift in energy landscape
    -   Hydropower
    -   Wind
    -   Solar
-   This report uses reliable data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/renewable-energy) to identify the **top 10 countries** by renewable energy share in 2023

# Methods

- Source: [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/renewable-energy)
- Focused on year **2023**  
- Removed regions (e.g., World, Asia)  
- Ranked countries by renewable share (%)  
- Based on **primary energy consumption**
- Conducted cross-country comparison on renewable composition in primary energy use

## Top 10 Countries by Renewable Share


- Ranked by % of primary energy from renewables  
- Norway leads with 72.1%, followed by Sweden and Brazil

## Discussion

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Hydropower dominance offers reliability  
- But it also introduces **climate risk**  
  - Droughts or reduced rainfall can affect generation  
- Other sources (wind, solar, bioenergy) are **underutilized**
