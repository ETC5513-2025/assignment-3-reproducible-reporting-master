# Our finding

-   Climate change and sustainability challenges
-   Shift in energy landscape
    -   Hydropower
    -   Wind
    -   Solar
-   This report uses reliable data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/renewable-energy) to identify the **top 10 countries** by renewable energy share in 2023

# Methods

- Source: [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/renewable-energy)
- Focused on year **2023**  
- Removed regions (e.g., World, Asia)  
- Ranked countries by renewable share (%)  
- Based on **primary energy consumption**
- Conducted cross-country comparison on renewable composition in primary energy use

## Top 10 Countries by Renewable Share


- Ranked by % of primary energy from renewables  
- Norway leads with 72.1%, followed by Sweden and Brazil

```{r fig-top10-bar, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Top 10 countries by renewable energy share in 2023"}
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)

data <- read_csv("renewable-share-energy.csv")

top10_clean <- data %>%
  filter(Year == 2023, 
         !Entity %in% c("World", "Africa", "Asia", "Europe", "Oceania", 
                        "North America", "South America", "Eastern Africa (EI)")) %>%
  arrange(desc(`Renewables (% equivalent primary energy)`)) %>%
  slice(1:10)

ggplot(top10_clean, aes(x = reorder(Entity, `Renewables (% equivalent primary energy)`), 
                        y = `Renewables (% equivalent primary energy)`, fill = Entity)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Renewable Share (%)") +

```


## Norway's Renewable Energy Composition (2023)

  
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- Hydropower: **91.2%**  
- Wind: 6.2%  
- Bioenergy: 2.1%  
- Solar: 0.5%  
- Shows Norway's natural advantage  
- Basis of its global renewable leadership

```{r fig-norway-pie, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

df <- data.frame(
  source = c("Hydropower", "Wind", "Bioenergy", "Solar"),
  share = c(91.2, 6.2, 2.1, 0.5)
)

df$label <- paste0(df$source, " (", df$share, "%)")

ggplot(df, aes(x = "", y = share, fill = label)) +
  geom_col(width = 1) +
  coord_polar("y") +
  theme_void() +
  labs(title = "Norway's Renewable Energy Composition (2023)")
```


Together, this unique energy mix positions Norway as a global leader in clean electricity generation.


## Small Country, Big Power: Norway vs. Global Top


::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

- Norway ranks high not just in renewable **share** but also in **absolute hydropower output**
- Over **270 TWh** hydro generation in 2023 despite small population
- Unique **topography** enables consistent and large-scale hydropower
- Global comparison confirms that Norway outperforms even larger nations in clean energy output
